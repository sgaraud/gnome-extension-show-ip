# Show IP in the GNOME Shell

This GNOME extension (v2) is simply showing current private IP in
GNOME shell status bar if Network Manager is used.  It has a popup
menu to select manually the network device to display if several are
activated on the machine. It supports both IPv4 and IPv6. Possibility to 
display public IP. Button for copying IP address into clipboard. Available in English and French.
